# MovieList #

MovieList is an Android application that its purpose is to manage a database (SQLite) that contains various movies' information.

* # Inserting a Movie #
The user can insert a new movie (with unique titles) alongside many details of it (such as Title, Director, Duration, Genre, Production Year, IMDb Rating).

* # Search Movies #
The user can search for movies either by their exact title, either by part of their title or by their director. The results will show all movies matching the search terms and if
the user taps on each of the results, can see further details about those movies.

* # Delete a Movie #
The user can delete any movie inserted to the database (as long as it exists).

* # Update a Movie #
The user can update the details of any movie that exists.

* # Show all Movies #
The user can get a list of all the movies' titles that exist in the database.

* # To be Done #
- The app will probably get merged with another app and possibly connect online with Firebase in order to add more uses to it.

- An icon will get added and app's name will get set to "MovieList".
